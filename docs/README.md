# G-Helper (with remapped keys)

### 🤔 Why did I make this?
I had recently broken the spacebar on my keyboard and around the same time I discovered that some Zephyrus G14 models had a different layouts for the function keys. Since I was going to order and replace my keyboard anyways, I was the perfect opportunity to order a new keyboard with the layout that I preferred. I though the drivers would automatically adjust to the new function key layout but that was not the case so I coded it myself.

Old Layout:                                                                                             New Layout:
